# 🏡 Moniepoint TakeHome Task - Real Estate App UI

This repository contains a Flutter-based mobile UI that faithfully translates the Real Estate App design from [this Dribbble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/23780608-Real-Estate-App).  
The project was developed as a technical test to demonstrate **design-to-code translation**, **scroll behavior reproduction**, and **animation accuracy** using Flutter.

## 🎯 Project Goal

> To convert a Dribbble design into a high-fidelity Flutter mobile application, replicating the layout, animations, scroll behavior, and visual structure as closely as possible.
